                                <p>The first thing that grabbed my attention was the colour scheme of the website. The
                                        website is covered in different muted, desaturated green shades. It provokes a
                                        sombre, melancholy, nostalgic, yet soothing feeling. It also reminds me of a
                                        sense of decay, like dying leaves on a lonely branch.</p>

                                <p> Observing<br>
                                        I observed the layout and design of the website. Similar to question 1, I think
                                        the website’s green colour theme portrays a sombre mood. The design is simple
                                        and reminds me of 2000s websites. The font used on the website is Arial. There
                                        are dark green boxes under random sets of words, containing looped sets of words
                                        and signs.<br>
                                        Clicking and hovering mouse<br>
                                        When I click on a box, a set of words appears along with certain music notes.
                                        When I click on the same box again, the box stops changing words, the color
                                        between the box and the word swaps, the note elongates for a bit and stops like
                                        pressing on a piano key. If I press the name of the poem on the top left, all
                                        the notes reset. If I hover to the X on the bottom right, the X rotates, and a
                                        blue list appears along with different poems and poets. Clicking mute mutes all
                                        sounds.<br>
                                        Listening<br>
                                        If I leave the box shuffling words, the word loops and the music loops also.
                                        Each box loops one note that plays every time a word changes. If I pause all the
                                        boxes, the music stops. I think this is note-worthy because I thought something
                                        would happen if I paused all the boxes. The boxes, in the order from left to
                                        right, play notes a pitch higher than its ascendant.</p>

                                <p>While the website itself is simple, there is much more to meet the eye and requires
                                        visitors to pay attention to a lot of details. I believe it is meant to convey a
                                        story; however, I haven’t found out what the story is yet. I believe the author
                                        is trying to incorporate feelings with seemingly simple, boring, structural
                                        words using the versatility and emotion of music and colour. Words from each box
                                        combined with quotation marks suggest a conversation being told. I believe it is
                                        a story because the author is Vietnamese (Nguyen is a Vietnamese surname), and
                                        Ocean Vuong is a Vietnamese American poet and novelist. Ocean Vuong is also a
                                        character in Vietnamese folklore. The website also references the Lovefeast,
                                        which is a meal eaten in common by a Christian congregation in token of
                                        brotherly.</p>

                                <p>I need to guess the goal of the website and I’m not really sure about it, so I don’t
                                        think the goals of the website was well communicated. There was no guide or
                                        explanation for the website either, just going straight into interacting.
                                        However, after some research, I have learnt that Tiger Dingsun – the author of
                                        the website – stated that he looked for non-linear text and poems to create the
                                        websites, which might be the reason why the content of the website seems
                                        confusing.</p>

                        <div class="answers">
                                <p>Personally, I would visit the website for 3 or 4 times, about 5 minutes each. There
                                        is not much content to interact with. The first time would be to get used to the
                                        website and see what it could do, but the function of the website and the
                                        intentions of the author would intrigue visitors for a second visit. On the
                                        second visit, visitors experiment more with the boxes, possibly find out about
                                        the sequence of melodies and words and come up with theories on the author’s
                                        purposes. However, it is common for simply designed yet dubious websites like
                                        this to contain some kind of secret, which leads to the third and final visit:
                                        to explore the secrets. I think it’s similar to exploring a game: getting used
                                        to the functions, then playing through the game, then finally finishing the
                                        Easter Eggs.</p>

                                        website suggests that the website contains little amount of content. The words
                                        and melodies might seem random at first, but if paid enough attention, it is
                                        quite easy to see a pattern. The website provides a short, simple yet intriguing
                                        experience that can be explored in a short amount of time, without requiring
                                        repeated visits.

                                        It’s a small, yet exciting “aha” moment nonetheless.</p>

                                        was expecting some surprises behind the little green boxes, but all they do are
                                        looping words and playing one music note. I spent a little while trying to
